Two variants of examples for the eBACOLI code:

1.  [./par](./par) - these examples use only the parabolic subsytem, which could be solved by BACOLI
2.  [./par-ode](./par-ode) - these examples incorporate ODE subsystems
3.  [./par-ellip](./par-ellip) - these examples incorporate elliptic subsystems
4.  [./par-ode-ellip](./par-ode-ellip) - these incorporate elliptic and ODE subsystems

Post-processing (with python scripts) example found in [./movie](./movie).

An additional directory that contains drivers and results related to http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3301320 is found in [./TOMS](./TOMS).
