#+TITLE: Source for ten Tusscher--Panfilov monodomain

[[./TenTusscher.f]] is generated from the CellML repository.

Jacobian of this model is evaluated using the functions =f_d_COLX.f=
which have been created through automatic differentiation. These
represent the Xth column of the Jacobian.

[[./TTP_ebacoli.f]] has two purposes:
1. It combines the cell model with the tissue equation, and
2. It wraps the CellML function evaluation and AD-generated Jacobian
   routines in a way callable from eBACOLI.
