#+TITLE: Standard parabolic system examples

From Paul Muir's [[http://cs.stmarys.ca/~muir/BACOLI-3_Webpage.htm][website]].

Downloaded [2017-05-31 Wed]. -- Modified to run with the ebacoli solver.

This directory builds example ebacoli programs as the command ~make~.

Resulting in the executables:

EXECUTABLES:=   burg1-simple       \
		burg2-simple       \
		steady-simple      \
		cahn_allen-simple  \
		rcdsys-simple      \
		burg1-curve        \
		burg2-curve        \
		steady-curve       \
		cahn_allen-curve   \
		rcdsys-curve       \
		burg1-trimesh      \
		burg2-trimesh      \
		steady-trimesh     \
		cahn_allen-trimesh \
		rcdsys-trimesh

*NOTE:* Files have been moved to capitals in file extension. This tells gfortran
to run them through the c preprocessor before applying the fortran compiler.
This is what allows us to compile executables for different sized systems with
ease.  System size is provided as ~#define MAC_NPDE <SIZE>~
