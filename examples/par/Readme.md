**NOTE:** Files have been moved to capitals in file extension. This tells `gfortran` to run them through the C preprocessor before applying the fortran compiler. This is what allows us to compile executables for different sized systems with ease. System size is provided as `#define MAC_NPDE <SIZE>`.
